Hey, I am always selecting labels such as car, person etc. . You can add a defualt value for them. For example if I select car, person, bus, truck as default labels. When I create a project, I can choose this as default without retyping it. Also, you can also add a default parameter for advanced section of creating new task. Every time I create a new task I have to rearrange the settings. For example I choose the segment size as 1000 every time. Sometimes I forget to set as 1000. When I forget it, I have to delete the task and reupload it. That wastes my time. Thanks in advance!!
